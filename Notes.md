# Develop a NFT Collection Lesson Notes

### Overview of Project

This project will build my understanding of NFTs, how they are developed, best practises, low-level instructions, advanced testing and programming techniques, and so much more.

By the end of this course I will have an NFT collection that can be deployed across chains and networks. Both static and dynamic NFTs will be covered.
